# Pong
Pong game using Pycharm and Pygame

This is a pong game made by heavily modifying the alien invasion game from Python Crash Course book.
The only difference between this game and the original pong game is that in this version, there are a total
of 6 paddles (3 controled by the user and 3 controlled by the AI) and the ball cannot touch any side of the screen.
